## I’m [Adam Demasi](https://kirb.me/).
I founded [**HASHBANG Productions**](https://hashbang.productions/) to build and release software for iOS and macOS. We’ve built [TypeStatus](https://typestatus.com/), [NewTerm](https://chariz.com/get/newterm), [MapsOpener](https://lifehacker.com/mapsopener-automatically-opens-map-links-in-google-maps-5969004), and [many more](https://github.com/hbang).

I’m a maintainer of the [**Theos**](https://theos.dev/) build system, the most commonly used solution for building iOS jailbreak software from a device running macOS, Linux, Windows, or even iOS itself.

Currently building [**Chariz**](https://chariz.com/), a directory and payment platform to help users find and buy great Mac and iOS software.
